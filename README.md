**Face Mask Detection using CNN and DNN 🧑‍⚖️🤖**

- This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning techniques. The solution combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for face mask classification with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for face detection.

**Key Components:**
- Face Detection with DNN 👀: The face detection is achieved using OpenCV's DNN module, which loads a pre-trained model based on the Caffe framework. This model detects faces in video frames with high accuracy and identifies regions of interest (ROIs) where the faces are located.

- Face Mask Classification with CNN 😷: After detecting faces, the regions are passed through a CNN model trained to classify whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers to extract features from the image and fully connected layers for classification.

Model Training 📚: The CNN model is trained on a custom dataset containing images labeled with "with_mask" and "without_mask" categories. The model uses ReLU activation functions in the hidden layers and Softmax in the output layer for multi-class classification. The model is trained with data augmentation to increase its robustness against variations in images.

Real-time Detection ⏱️: The system can detect faces and predict whether the individual is wearing a mask in real-time using webcam input. The detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the mask status is displayed with green (mask ✅) or red (no mask ❌).

**Technologies Used:**
- Python 🐍 and TensorFlow for deep learning model development.
- OpenCV for face detection and real-time video processing.
- Keras for CNN model architecture.
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Caffe pre-trained model for face detection via DNN.
